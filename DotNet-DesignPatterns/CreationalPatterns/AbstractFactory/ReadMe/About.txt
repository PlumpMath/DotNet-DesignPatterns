Abstract Factory
----------------
Creates an instance of several families of classes
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

Participants
------------

The classes and objects participating in this pattern are: 

•AbstractFactory  (AssetClassFactory) 
	◦declares an interface for operations that create abstract products 

•ConcreteFactory   (USFactory, CanadaFactory) 
	◦implements the operations to create concrete product objects 

•AbstractProduct   (Equity, FixedIncome) 
	◦declares an interface for a type of product object 

•Product  (USBuy,CanBuy,USFixedIncome, CanadaFixedIncome) 
	◦defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory 
	◦implements the AbstractProduct interface 

•Client  (OrderManager)
	 ◦uses interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes
